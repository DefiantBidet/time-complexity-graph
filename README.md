# Charting Time Complexity


## Todo.....

idea:
start with known performant entities (binary search/quick sort/etc)
chart known perf - constant/linear/logarithmic/etc
  - create a sim that will run 10/50/100/500/1K/5K/10K/50k/100k
get chart all purty like
implement ability to add implementation to run sim
