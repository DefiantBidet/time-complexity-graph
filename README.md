# Charting Time Complexity
### ⚠️ This repo is a Work In Progress ⚠️

this repo came about from finding the [JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures repo](https://github.com/trekhleb/javascript-algorithms).

The idea is to be able to apply an algorithm to run a simulation against and plot the results.

## Todo.....
 - implement a few data structures and sorting algos
 - run iteration loop over structure
    - start performance timer
    - end performance timer on completion of each iteration
    - store/chart access/search/insertion/deletion for each algo
